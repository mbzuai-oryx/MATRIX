I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['re', 'pickle', 'xml', 'matplotlib', 'json', 'time', 'collections', 'itertools', 'random', 'statistics', 'sklearn', 'pandas', 'pptx', 'unicodedata', 'queue', 'pubchempy', 'fractions', 'torch', 'csv', 'Bio', 'io', 'PIL', 'datetime', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'scipy', 'chess', 'bs4', 'PyPDF2', 'requests', 'stat', 'cv2', 'os', 'yahoo_finance', 'numpy', 'sympy', 'math']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['PIL', 'io', 'torch', 'zipfile', 'requests', 'pydub', 'chess', 'random', 'pubchempy', 're', 'time', 'pptx', 'pickle', 'statistics', 'unicodedata', 'numpy', 'math', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'queue', 'stat', 'bs4', 'os', 'sympy', 'datetime', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'itertools', 'cv2', 'csv', 'collections', 'matplotlib', 'json', 'fractions', 'yahoo_finance']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['pickle', 'collections', 'chess', 'time', 'io', 'unicodedata', 'fractions', 'requests', 'statistics', 'Bio', 'xml', 'matplotlib', 'os', 'stat', 'sympy', 're', 'yahoo_finance', 'PIL', 'csv', 'scipy', 'pptx', 'torch', 'zipfile', 'random', 'json', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'pydub', 'numpy', 'math', 'cv2', 'pandas', 'pubchempy', 'PyPDF2', 'queue']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. DO NOT generate a code which does not call 'print()' because you will lose this information. You can assume all tools must have a return that can be printed. \nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nYou will save all intermediate file outputs to a folder by the relative path '.cache'.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. \n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = ask_search_agent(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = ask_search_agent(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = ask_search_agent(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

Attachment: .cache/table1.jpg\"\n\nThought: To convert the table in the image to a pie chart, I will first need to extract the text from the image to get the data that is presented in the table. I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['sympy', 'os', 'random', 'stat', 'chess', 'datetime', 'Bio', 'pubchempy', 'time', 're', 'requests', 'pydub', 'xml', 'PIL', 'pptx', 'cv2', 'pandas', 'csv', 'PyPDF2', 'matplotlib', 'torch', 'statistics', 'math', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'scipy', 'collections', 'yahoo_finance', 'json', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'pickle', 'numpy', 'sklearn', 'queue', 'zipfile', 'fractions']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'scipy', 'PIL', 'pickle', 'bs4', 're', 'cv2', 'unicodedata', 'Bio', 'fractions', 'sklearn', 'pydub', 'collections', 'itertools', 'torch', 'pptx', 'yahoo_finance', 'numpy', 'matplotlib', 'PyPDF2', 'sympy', 'datetime', 'time', 'xml', 'random', 'chess', 'requests', 'pandas', 'csv', 'math', 'zipfile', 'json', 'stat', 'statistics', 'os']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['csv', 'statistics', 'collections', 'time', 'math', 'matplotlib', 'PIL', 'random', 'sklearn', 'sympy', 'Bio', 'unicodedata', 'json', 'requests', 'pubchempy', 'torch', 'cv2', 'queue', 'chess', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'PyPDF2', 'pptx', 'os', 'pickle', 'io', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'xml', 'pydub', 'numpy', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'yahoo_finance', 'datetime', 're']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

Attachment: .cache/table1.jpg\"\n\nThought: To convert the table in the image to a pie chart, I will first need to extract the text from the image to get the data that is presented in the table. I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['pickle', 'random', 'json', 'os', 'queue', 'cv2', 'sklearn', 'pubchempy', 'stat', 'unicodedata', 'chess', 'PyPDF2', 'csv', 'yahoo_finance', 'scipy', 'statistics', 'fractions', 'pptx', 'collections', 'pydub', 'datetime', 're', 'xml', 'torch', 'Bio', 'numpy', 'bs4', 'time', 'requests', 'io', 'itertools', 'pandas', 'PIL', 'zipfile', 'math', 'sympy', 'matplotlib']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['stat', 'torch', 'random', 'fractions', 'io', 'pubchempy', 'statistics', 'Bio', 'PyPDF2', 're', 'sklearn', 'pandas', 'chess', 'zipfile', 'os', 'datetime', 'pickle', 'math', 'pptx', 'collections', 'cv2', 'numpy', 'csv', 'json', 'scipy', 'bs4', 'unicodedata', 'requests', 'sympy', 'queue', 'xml', 'itertools', 'PIL', 'matplotlib', 'pydub', 'yahoo_finance', 'time']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['pandas', 'Bio', 'sympy', 'xml', 'math', 'torch', 'chess', 'io', 'os', 'bs4', 'zipfile', 'time', 'pptx', 'statistics', 'random', 'scipy', 'pubchempy', 'pydub', 'unicodedata', 'PyPDF2', 'pickle', 'itertools', 'queue', 'numpy', 'fractions', 'cv2', 'sklearn', 'csv', 'collections', 'yahoo_finance', 're', 'stat', 'PIL', 'matplotlib', 'requests', 'json', 'datetime']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

Search Outcome (Short Version):\n\nGreen tea is rich in polyphenols, particularly catechins like EGCG, which are antioxidants that offer numerous health benefits. Recent studies highlight its potential in preventing cardiovascular diseases, aiding in weight management, enhancing brain function, and providing anti-cancer properties.\n\n### 2. Search Outcome (Extremely Detailed Version):\n\nRecent research and literature reviews reveal that green tea's health benefits are primarily due to its polyphenolic content, especially EGCG. These compounds exhibit antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and metabolism-boosting properties. Specific studies indicate:\n\n- **Cardiovascular Benefits**: Regular consumption of green tea has been associated with reduced risk factors for heart disease. Polyphenols in green tea help in reducing blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\n- **Cancer Prevention**: Green tea has shown cancer chemopreventive abilities attributed to the action of catechins, which may inhibit cancer cell growth and migration.\n\n- **Cognitive Health**: Studies have found that green tea can enhance brain function and may lower the risk of cognitive decline in older adults.\n\n- **Weight Loss Support**: Green tea boosts metabolism, particularly when combined with exercise, aiding in weight management.\n\n- **Anti-Diabetic Effects**: Long-term intake may contribute to controlling blood sugar levels and reducing risk factors for type II diabetes.\n\nEvidence is well-substantiated by in vitro, in vivo, and human studies, though more research is warranted to further understand the mechanisms and confirm these benefits.\n\n### 3. Additional Context:\n\nGreen tea has been consumed for centuries, initially gaining popularity in Asia and later spreading globally. It is made from unfermented leaves, which helps retain its natural polyphenols. The cultural significance of green tea continues today, emphasized in traditional tea ceremonies and its incorporation into modern wellness regimes. Its holistic approach not only targets specific health diseases but also promotes overall well-being. This age-old beverage remains a focal point in health-related dietary research due to its complex mixture of health-promoting compounds.\n"

Search outcome (extremely detailed version):\nRecent studies reveal that green tea consumption exhibits a significant positive influence on cardiovascular health by reducing cardiometabolic risks and hypercholesterolemia. The systematic review conducted recently concluded that regular green tea consumption lowers both diastolic and systolic blood pressures, reducing the risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Research also highlights green tea's potential role in preventing various types of cancer and providing neuroprotective effects.\n\nGreen tea's health-promoting effects are attributed to its polyphenol content, accounting for up to 30% of the dry weight. These polyphenols consist mostly of flavonols, known as catechins. Studies using animal models have shown that green tea catechins protect against degenerative diseases. Green tea consumption is linked to the prevention of cancer types like lung, colon, and esophagus, alongside boosting antioxidant capacity and reducing oxidative stress.\n\n### 3. Additional context:\nHistorically valued for its health benefits, green tea's significance is widely acknowledged in many cultures, particularly in Asia. It is processed to maintain its high catechin content, making it more beneficial than black or oolong tea. Despite its benefits, moderate consumption is recommended due to potential side effects such as interactions with medications or sensitivity in some individuals. Continuous research is essential to fully understand its mechanisms and establish standard consumption guidelines.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'scipy', 'PIL', 'pickle', 'bs4', 're', 'cv2', 'unicodedata', 'Bio', 'fractions', 'sklearn', 'pydub', 'collections', 'itertools', 'torch', 'pptx', 'yahoo_finance', 'numpy', 'matplotlib', 'PyPDF2', 'sympy', 'datetime', 'time', 'xml', 'random', 'chess', 'requests', 'pandas', 'csv', 'math', 'zipfile', 'json', 'stat', 'statistics', 'os']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['xml', 'pydub', 'stat', 'Bio', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'pandas', 'scipy', 'io', 'csv', 'pubchempy', 'chess', 'math', 're', 'matplotlib', 'pptx', 'sympy', 'zipfile', 'fractions', 'pickle', 'queue', 'torch', 'sklearn', 'PIL', 'requests', 'datetime', 'collections', 'bs4', 'statistics', 'yahoo_finance', 'json', 'random', 'itertools', 'unicodedata', 'cv2', 'numpy', 'time']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'queue', 'PIL', 'requests', 'random', 'datetime', 'matplotlib', 'zipfile', 'cv2', 'unicodedata', 'Bio', 'sklearn', 'pubchempy', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'io', 'fractions', 'xml', 'statistics', 'itertools', 're', 'pptx', 'numpy', 'pandas', 'csv', 'time', 'chess', 'torch', 'pickle', 'collections', 'json', 'yahoo_finance', 'PyPDF2', 'os', 'sympy', 'pydub', 'stat']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['csv', 'statistics', 'collections', 'time', 'math', 'matplotlib', 'PIL', 'random', 'sklearn', 'sympy', 'Bio', 'unicodedata', 'json', 'requests', 'pubchempy', 'torch', 'cv2', 'queue', 'chess', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'PyPDF2', 'pptx', 'os', 'pickle', 'io', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'xml', 'pydub', 'numpy', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'yahoo_finance', 'datetime', 're']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

Attachment: .cache/table1.jpg\"\n\nThought: To convert the table in the image to a pie chart, I will first need to extract the text from the image to get the data that is presented in the table. I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['torch', 'os', 'PIL', 'math', 'numpy', 'datetime', 'zipfile', 'collections', 'random', 'chess', 'scipy', 'pubchempy', 'pickle', 'requests', 'pptx', 'sklearn', 'io', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'cv2', 'unicodedata', 'itertools', 'time', 'xml', 're', 'json', 'csv', 'Bio', 'pydub', 'matplotlib', 'statistics', 'PyPDF2', 'bs4', 'queue', 'yahoo_finance', 'stat', 'sympy']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'scipy', 'PIL', 'pickle', 'bs4', 're', 'cv2', 'unicodedata', 'Bio', 'fractions', 'sklearn', 'pydub', 'collections', 'itertools', 'torch', 'pptx', 'yahoo_finance', 'numpy', 'matplotlib', 'PyPDF2', 'sympy', 'datetime', 'time', 'xml', 'random', 'chess', 'requests', 'pandas', 'csv', 'math', 'zipfile', 'json', 'stat', 'statistics', 'os']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['yahoo_finance', 'statistics', 'datetime', 'numpy', 'math', 'cv2', 'fractions', 'chess', 'zipfile', 'scipy', 'sympy', 'time', 'collections', 'pptx', 'json', 'requests', 'queue', 'xml', 're', 'pickle', 'PyPDF2', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'torch', 'stat', 'os', 'sklearn', 'io', 'matplotlib', 'pydub', 'csv', 'unicodedata', 'pubchempy', 'random', 'PIL', 'itertools', 'pandas']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'scipy', 'PIL', 'pickle', 'bs4', 're', 'cv2', 'unicodedata', 'Bio', 'fractions', 'sklearn', 'pydub', 'collections', 'itertools', 'torch', 'pptx', 'yahoo_finance', 'numpy', 'matplotlib', 'PyPDF2', 'sympy', 'datetime', 'time', 'xml', 'random', 'chess', 'requests', 'pandas', 'csv', 'math', 'zipfile', 'json', 'stat', 'statistics', 'os']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

Attachment: .cache/table1.jpg\"\n\nThought: To convert the table in the image to a pie chart, I will first need to extract the text from the image to get the data that is presented in the table. I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved. Now, I will use the `final_answer` tool to provide the path to the saved pie chart as the final output.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Pie chart saved at: data/tongagent/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Identify and list the types of fruits visible in this image. Attachment: .cache/000000202178.jpg\"\n\nThought: I will use the `objectlocation` tool to identify and list the types of fruits visible in the provided image. This tool will help localize different fruits present in the image, and I can then compile the identified types.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_types = objectlocation(object=\"fruit\", image_path=\".cache/000000202178.jpg\")\nprint(fruit_types)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: [[173.91, 2.34, 372.53, 87.86], [170.28, 2.32, 398.48, 121.89], [410.71, 42.45, 483.26, 130.54]]\n\n\nThought: Now, I have found bounding boxes of fruits. I will crop these regions of fruits and save in new files.\nCode:\n```py\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\nimage_path = \".cache/000000202178.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(image_path)\n\nroot = \".cache/output\"\nos.makedirs(root, exist_ok=True)\ncount = 0\nfor bbox in fruit_types:\n   crop_image = image.crop(bbox)\n   crop_image.save(f'{root}/{count}.jpg')\n   print(f'{root}/{count}.jpg')\n   count = count+1\n```<end_action>\nObservation: .cache/output/0.jpg, .cache/output/1.jpg, .cache/output/2.jpg,\n\nThought: I will list all the images in the folder '.cache/output', then apply the `visualizer` tool to each image for the types of fruits.\nCode: \n```py\nimage_folder_path = '.cache/output'\nimage_files = [file for file in os.listdir(image_folder_path) if file.endswith(('.jpg', '.png', '.jpeg'))]\nfor image_file in image_files:\n    image_path = os.path.join(image_folder_path, image_file)\n    fruit_type = visualizer(question=\"What types of fruits are visible in this image?\", image_path=image_path)\n    print(fruit_type)\nObservation: Pineapple\nBananas\nMango\n```<end_action>\n\nThought: I have identified the types of fruits present in the image. Now, I will compile the list of fruits and return it as the final answer.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_list = [\n    \"Pineapple\",\n    \"Bananas\",\n    \"Mango\"\n]\nfinal_answer(fruit_list)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['sklearn', 'pickle', 're', 'statistics', 'pptx', 'xml', 'zipfile', 'chess', 'Bio', 'bs4', 'yahoo_finance', 'stat', 'random', 'unicodedata', 'PyPDF2', 'numpy', 'json', 'collections', 'PIL', 'sympy', 'csv', 'io', 'torch', 'fractions', 'pydub', 'matplotlib', 'os', 'datetime', 'math', 'time', 'queue', 'pubchempy', 'itertools', 'scipy', 'cv2', 'requests', 'pandas']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

Attachment: .cache/table1.jpg\"\n\nThought: To convert the table in the image to a pie chart, I will first need to extract the text from the image to get the data that is presented in the table. I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved. Now, I will use the `final_answer` tool to provide the path to the saved pie chart as the final output.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Pie chart saved at: data/tongagent/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Identify and list the types of fruits visible in this image.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['pandas', 'os', 'numpy', 'fractions', 'pydub', 're', 'sympy', 'io', 'pptx', 'chess', 'math', 'sklearn', 'scipy', 'matplotlib', 'pubchempy', 'PIL', 'cv2', 'statistics', 'yahoo_finance', 'unicodedata', 'collections', 'json', 'requests', 'random', 'itertools', 'time', 'queue', 'stat', 'pickle', 'torch', 'bs4', 'datetime', 'Bio', 'xml', 'csv', 'PyPDF2', 'zipfile']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.

You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'stat', 'pandas', 'chess', 'csv', 'requests', 'scipy', 'random', 're', 'sklearn', 'itertools', 'json', 'yahoo_finance', 'io', 'statistics', 'cv2', 'matplotlib', 'pptx', 'pickle', 'collections', 'unicodedata', 'sympy', 'os', 'torch', 'bs4', 'queue', 'pubchempy', 'fractions', 'datetime', 'time', 'Bio', 'numpy', 'PIL', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'PyPDF2', 'xml']\n9.

Attachment: .cache/table1.jpg\"\n\nThought: To convert the table in the image to a pie chart, I will first need to extract the text from the image to get the data that is presented in the table. I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

Search outcome (extremely detailed version):\n- **Black Lives Matter (2020)**: Spanned across 550 locations, peaking on June 6 with half a million in one day. Fueled by the death of George Floyd and systemic racism. It has been a decentralized but powerful movement, influencing global discourse on racial equality.\n- **Women's March (2017)**: Took place worldwide, highlighting issues like gender equality, reproductive rights, and civil rights. Spurred by political events in the U.S., it emphasized women's voices in public policy.\n- **March on Washington (1963)**: Held on August 28 in Washington, D.C., it was pivotal for the U.S. civil rights movement. MLK’s speech galvanized support for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It was a nonviolent protest advocating for civil and economic rights.\n- **Tiananmen Square Protests (1989)**: Originated in Beijing and spread to 400 cities. Triggered by political corruption and calls for democratic reforms. It culminated in military action, with an undisclosed number of protester casualties. It remains a sensitive subject in China but highlighted global human rights issues.\n\n### 3. Additional context:\n- These movements reflect societal grievances and desire for change, often leading to substantive legislation or policy shifts.\n- The scale of a demonstration often correlates with its impact but isn't the sole indicator of success; media coverage and political environment are also crucial.\n- Demonstrations like Tiananmen remain historically significant despite repression, showing the persistent global push for civil rights and democracy.\n- These events are part of broader social movements that continue influencing political landscapes worldwide.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['xml', 'pydub', 'stat', 'Bio', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'pandas', 'scipy', 'io', 'csv', 'pubchempy', 'chess', 'math', 're', 'matplotlib', 'pptx', 'sympy', 'zipfile', 'fractions', 'pickle', 'queue', 'torch', 'sklearn', 'PIL', 'requests', 'datetime', 'collections', 'bs4', 'statistics', 'yahoo_finance', 'json', 'random', 'itertools', 'unicodedata', 'cv2', 'numpy', 'time']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

This month, the prices have shown a slight decrease compared to the previous month, which was $4.780 for regular. A year ago, the prices were significantly higher, with regular gas costing $5.817 on average.\n\n### 3. Additional context:\nCalifornia's gas prices are influenced by multiple factors, including high state taxes, environmental regulation costs, and refinery issues. Historically, California has some of the highest gas prices in the U.S. due to these components. Recent trends indicate a decrease in gas prices likely due to lower crude oil prices and easing demand as the summer driving season ends. However, California prices remain above the national average. Understanding these factors provides a comprehensive picture of the current gas pricing landscape in California.\n"

This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.

And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['csv', 'statistics', 'collections', 'time', 'math', 'matplotlib', 'PIL', 'random', 'sklearn', 'sympy', 'Bio', 'unicodedata', 'json', 'requests', 'pubchempy', 'torch', 'cv2', 'queue', 'chess', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'PyPDF2', 'pptx', 'os', 'pickle', 'io', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'xml', 'pydub', 'numpy', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'yahoo_finance', 'datetime', 're']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

From a low of approximately $6,612 in 2019 to highs exceeding $75,000 in 2024, Bitcoin's market behavior has been influenced by economic factors and market sentiment. \n\n### 2. Search outcome (extremely detailed version): \nBetween 2020 and 2024, Bitcoin experienced dramatic price changes, starting at $7,161 in January 2020 and closing that year at $28,993, a rise of 416%. In 2021, Bitcoin burst past $40,000 and reached $64,895 in April. Another peak of $69,000 was recorded in November 2021. Prices fluctuated in 2022, dropping below $20,000 by year-end. Bitcoin started 2023 at $16,530 and climbed steadily, closing the year at $42,258. 2024 saw approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, leading to the price breaching $70,000, ultimately achieving $75,830 by mid-2024.\n\n### 3. Additional context: \nBitcoin's price movements have tracked broader economic indicators. The alignment of price trends with traditional stock markets indicates institutional adoption and Bitcoin's role as a diversified asset. Regulatory developments, macroeconomic uncertainties, global events like the COVID-19 pandemic, and the emergence of financial products such as ETFs have significantly impacted Bitcoin's trajectory. This trend of volatility combined with periods of rapid growth and corrections underscores both the opportunities and risks in Bitcoin investment.\n"

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['pandas', 'Bio', 'sympy', 'xml', 'math', 'torch', 'chess', 'io', 'os', 'bs4', 'zipfile', 'time', 'pptx', 'statistics', 'random', 'scipy', 'pubchempy', 'pydub', 'unicodedata', 'PyPDF2', 'pickle', 'itertools', 'queue', 'numpy', 'fractions', 'cv2', 'sklearn', 'csv', 'collections', 'yahoo_finance', 're', 'stat', 'PIL', 'matplotlib', 'requests', 'json', 'datetime']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['pickle', 'collections', 'chess', 'time', 'io', 'unicodedata', 'fractions', 'requests', 'statistics', 'Bio', 'xml', 'matplotlib', 'os', 'stat', 'sympy', 're', 'yahoo_finance', 'PIL', 'csv', 'scipy', 'pptx', 'torch', 'zipfile', 'random', 'json', 'sklearn', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'pydub', 'numpy', 'math', 'cv2', 'pandas', 'pubchempy', 'PyPDF2', 'queue']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. DO NOT generate a code which does not call 'print()' because you will lose this information.

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

Attachment: .cache/table1.jpg\"\n\nThought: To convert the table in the image to a pie chart, I will first need to extract the text from the image to get the data that is presented in the table. I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved. Now, I will use the `final_answer` tool to provide the path to the saved pie chart as the final output.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Pie chart saved at: data/tongagent/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Identify and list the types of fruits visible in this image. Attachment: .cache/000000202178.jpg\"\n\nThought: I will use the `objectlocation` tool to identify and list the types of fruits visible in the provided image. This tool will help localize different fruits present in the image, and I can then compile the identified types.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_types = objectlocation(object=\"fruit\", image_path=\".cache/000000202178.jpg\")\nprint(fruit_types)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: [[173.91, 2.34, 372.53, 87.86], [170.28, 2.32, 398.48, 121.89], [410.71, 42.45, 483.26, 130.54]]\n\n\nThought: Now, I have found bounding boxes of fruits. I will crop these regions of fruits and save in new files.\nCode:\n```py\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\nimage_path = \".cache/000000202178.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(image_path)\n\nroot = \".cache/output\"\nos.makedirs(root, exist_ok=True)\ncount = 0\nfor bbox in fruit_types:\n   crop_image = image.crop(bbox)\n   crop_image.save(f'{root}/{count}.jpg')\n   print(f'{root}/{count}.jpg')\n   count = count+1\n```<end_action>\nObservation: .cache/output/0.jpg, .cache/output/1.jpg, .cache/output/2.jpg,\n\nThought: I will list all the images in the folder '.cache/output', then apply the `visualizer` tool to each image for the types of fruits.\nCode: \n```py\nimage_folder_path = '.cache/output'\nimage_files = [file for file in os.listdir(image_folder_path) if file.endswith(('.jpg', '.png', '.jpeg'))]\nfor image_file in image_files:\n    image_path = os.path.join(image_folder_path, image_file)\n    fruit_type = visualizer(question=\"What types of fruits are visible in this image?\", image_path=image_path)\n    print(fruit_type)\nObservation: Pineapple\nBananas\nMango\n```<end_action>\n\nThought: I have identified the types of fruits present in the image. Now, I will compile the list of fruits and return it as the final answer.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_list = [\n    \"Pineapple\",\n    \"Bananas\",\n    \"Mango\"\n]\nfinal_answer(fruit_list)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['sklearn', 'pickle', 're', 'statistics', 'pptx', 'xml', 'zipfile', 'chess', 'Bio', 'bs4', 'yahoo_finance', 'stat', 'random', 'unicodedata', 'PyPDF2', 'numpy', 'json', 'collections', 'PIL', 'sympy', 'csv', 'io', 'torch', 'fractions', 'pydub', 'matplotlib', 'os', 'datetime', 'math', 'time', 'queue', 'pubchempy', 'itertools', 'scipy', 'cv2', 'requests', 'pandas']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt.

Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['csv', 'statistics', 'collections', 'time', 'math', 'matplotlib', 'PIL', 'random', 'sklearn', 'sympy', 'Bio', 'unicodedata', 'json', 'requests', 'pubchempy', 'torch', 'cv2', 'queue', 'chess', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'PyPDF2', 'pptx', 'os', 'pickle', 'io', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'xml', 'pydub', 'numpy', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'yahoo_finance', 'datetime', 're']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

Search Outcome (Extremely Detailed Version):\n\n- **Allrecipes:** The 'One Bowl Chocolate Cake' uses 2 cups of white sugar, which is about 400 grams. This recipe offers a simple, rich chocolate flavor and is noted for its moist texture.\n  \n- **BBC Good Food:** The 'Easy Chocolate Cake' requires 200 grams of caster sugar. This recipe emphasizes an airy sponge and is considered simple yet elegant, suitable for afternoon teas or special occasions.\n  \n- **King Arthur Baking:** The 'Sourdough Chocolate Cake' incorporates 298 grams of sugar. This recipe is unique due to its use of sourdough starter, offering a richer chocolate taste without the sour notes. The cake is complemented by a coffee icing, adding depth to the chocolate flavor.\n\n### 3. Additional Context:\n\n- **Role of Sugar in Baking:** Sugar is crucial not just for sweetness but also for texture and moisture. It helps create a tender crumb by inhibiting gluten formation. The choice between granulated and caster sugar affects the final texture, with caster sugar dissolving more readily to create a finer crumb.\n  \n- **Comparative Analysis:** Recipe sugar quantities vary based on the desired taste and texture. Allrecipes uses more sugar for a richer, denser cake, while BBC's version provides a lighter texture. King Arthur Baking’s unique use of sourdough and a moderate sugar level maintains richness while incorporating unique flavors.\n  \n- **Sugar Alternatives:** For those needing alternatives due to dietary restrictions, options like coconut sugar, stevia, or applesauce can be considered, but adjustments in quantity may be necessary.\n\nThis detailed analysis provides a clear understanding of common practices for sugar use in chocolate cakes across reliable baking sites, offering insight into variations and their culinary implications.\n"

For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['PIL', 'io', 'torch', 'zipfile', 'requests', 'pydub', 'chess', 'random', 'pubchempy', 're', 'time', 'pptx', 'pickle', 'statistics', 'unicodedata', 'numpy', 'math', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'queue', 'stat', 'bs4', 'os', 'sympy', 'datetime', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'itertools', 'cv2', 'csv', 'collections', 'matplotlib', 'json', 'fractions', 'yahoo_finance']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.

You can assume all tools must have a return that can be printed. \nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nYou will save all intermediate file outputs to a folder by the relative path '.cache'.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. \n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = ask_search_agent(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = ask_search_agent(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = ask_search_agent(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['time', 'queue', 'json', 'io', 'torch', 'random', 'zipfile', 'numpy', 'fractions', 'matplotlib', 'statistics', 'PyPDF2', 'pickle', 'requests', 'itertools', 'math', 'scipy', 'os', 'sklearn', 're', 'xml', 'PIL', 'Bio', 'unicodedata', 'csv', 'pptx', 'chess', 'stat', 'sympy', 'pydub', 'cv2', 'yahoo_finance', 'collections', 'bs4', 'pandas', 'datetime', 'pubchempy']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['xml', 'pydub', 'stat', 'Bio', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'pandas', 'scipy', 'io', 'csv', 'pubchempy', 'chess', 'math', 're', 'matplotlib', 'pptx', 'sympy', 'zipfile', 'fractions', 'pickle', 'queue', 'torch', 'sklearn', 'PIL', 'requests', 'datetime', 'collections', 'bs4', 'statistics', 'yahoo_finance', 'json', 'random', 'itertools', 'unicodedata', 'cv2', 'numpy', 'time']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['re', 'pickle', 'xml', 'matplotlib', 'json', 'time', 'collections', 'itertools', 'random', 'statistics', 'sklearn', 'pandas', 'pptx', 'unicodedata', 'queue', 'pubchempy', 'fractions', 'torch', 'csv', 'Bio', 'io', 'PIL', 'datetime', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'scipy', 'chess', 'bs4', 'PyPDF2', 'requests', 'stat', 'cv2', 'os', 'yahoo_finance', 'numpy', 'sympy', 'math']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5.

The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'stat', 'pandas', 'chess', 'csv', 'requests', 'scipy', 'random', 're', 'sklearn', 'itertools', 'json', 'yahoo_finance', 'io', 'statistics', 'cv2', 'matplotlib', 'pptx', 'pickle', 'collections', 'unicodedata', 'sympy', 'os', 'torch', 'bs4', 'queue', 'pubchempy', 'fractions', 'datetime', 'time', 'Bio', 'numpy', 'PIL', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'PyPDF2', 'xml']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

Search outcome (extremely detailed version):\nAccording to My Baking Addiction, a well-regarded culinary website, a chocolate cake baked at 350 degrees Fahrenheit should be prepared in either two 9-inch round baking pans or one 13x9x2-inch rectangular pan. The baking time is approximately 30 to 35 minutes for round pans and 35 to 40 minutes for the rectangular pan. The cake is considered done when a wooden toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. This specific recipe includes ingredients such as cocoa powder and coffee, which enhance the chocolate flavor. Additional insights from the recipe include the optional use of Dutch process cocoa for deeper flavor and alternative ingredients like water for coffee if desired.\n\n### 3. Additional context:\nSeveral factors can affect the baking time of a chocolate cake, including oven calibration, pan size and material, and even altitude. For instance, high altitude may require modification of ingredients or baking time. The moisture in the cake can also be influenced by ingredients like oil and buttermilk, as used in the recipe from My Baking Addiction. Adjustments may include checking the cake slightly earlier to prevent overbaking and ensuring an even bake by rotating pans if necessary. The recipe also suggests a fun twist by substituting coffee with water, which doesn't change the moisture level but affects flavor depth.\n\nFor alternative baking methods, some recipes recommend trying different temperatures or baking with steam for additional moisture, although this particular recipe is optimized for traditional baking at 350 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nTo achieve the best results, it is suggested to follow the recipe closely while also being mindful of individual oven differences.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'queue', 'PIL', 'requests', 'random', 'datetime', 'matplotlib', 'zipfile', 'cv2', 'unicodedata', 'Bio', 'sklearn', 'pubchempy', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'io', 'fractions', 'xml', 'statistics', 'itertools', 're', 'pptx', 'numpy', 'pandas', 'csv', 'time', 'chess', 'torch', 'pickle', 'collections', 'json', 'yahoo_finance', 'PyPDF2', 'os', 'sympy', 'pydub', 'stat']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`.

And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['sklearn', 'scipy', 'json', 'stat', 'pandas', 'time', 'yahoo_finance', 'zipfile', 'bs4', 'matplotlib', 'pubchempy', 'cv2', 'io', 'unicodedata', 'random', 'collections', 'statistics', 'math', 'pydub', 'numpy', 're', 'PyPDF2', 'pptx', 'sympy', 'pickle', 'PIL', 'torch', 'xml', 'queue', 'fractions', 'itertools', 'requests', 'os', 'Bio', 'csv', 'datetime', 'chess']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['sympy', 'os', 'random', 'stat', 'chess', 'datetime', 'Bio', 'pubchempy', 'time', 're', 'requests', 'pydub', 'xml', 'PIL', 'pptx', 'cv2', 'pandas', 'csv', 'PyPDF2', 'matplotlib', 'torch', 'statistics', 'math', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'scipy', 'collections', 'yahoo_finance', 'json', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'pickle', 'numpy', 'sklearn', 'queue', 'zipfile', 'fractions']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['re', 'pickle', 'xml', 'matplotlib', 'json', 'time', 'collections', 'itertools', 'random', 'statistics', 'sklearn', 'pandas', 'pptx', 'unicodedata', 'queue', 'pubchempy', 'fractions', 'torch', 'csv', 'Bio', 'io', 'PIL', 'datetime', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'scipy', 'chess', 'bs4', 'PyPDF2', 'requests', 'stat', 'cv2', 'os', 'yahoo_finance', 'numpy', 'sympy', 'math']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['yahoo_finance', 'statistics', 'datetime', 'numpy', 'math', 'cv2', 'fractions', 'chess', 'zipfile', 'scipy', 'sympy', 'time', 'collections', 'pptx', 'json', 'requests', 'queue', 'xml', 're', 'pickle', 'PyPDF2', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'torch', 'stat', 'os', 'sklearn', 'io', 'matplotlib', 'pydub', 'csv', 'unicodedata', 'pubchempy', 'random', 'PIL', 'itertools', 'pandas']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['csv', 'statistics', 'collections', 'time', 'math', 'matplotlib', 'PIL', 'random', 'sklearn', 'sympy', 'Bio', 'unicodedata', 'json', 'requests', 'pubchempy', 'torch', 'cv2', 'queue', 'chess', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'PyPDF2', 'pptx', 'os', 'pickle', 'io', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'xml', 'pydub', 'numpy', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'yahoo_finance', 'datetime', 're']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

Additional context:\nThe caloric content of pepperoni pizza is influenced by several factors such as slice size, crust type (thick, thin, pan), and cooking methods (fresh or frozen). For those monitoring their caloric intake, considering these variables can guide healthier choices. Pepperoni pizza also provides protein and fat, contributing to daily nutritional goals. Comparing these calorie counts with daily caloric recommendations can help individuals balance their diet, keeping in mind that a typical diet includes about 2000-2500 calories per day.\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. DO NOT generate a code which does not call 'print()' because you will lose this information. You can assume all tools must have a return that can be printed. \nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nYou will save all intermediate file outputs to a folder by the relative path '.cache'.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. \n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = ask_search_agent(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = ask_search_agent(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = ask_search_agent(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

Attachment: .cache/table1.jpg\"\n\nThought: To convert the table in the image to a pie chart, I will first need to extract the text from the image to get the data that is presented in the table. I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

Now, I will compile the list of fruits and return it as the final answer.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_list = [\n    \"Pineapple\",\n    \"Bananas\",\n    \"Mango\"\n]\nfinal_answer(fruit_list)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['csv', 'sympy', 'pubchempy', 'torch', 'pandas', 'time', 'fractions', 'xml', 'io', 'statistics', 'collections', 'itertools', 'cv2', 'json', 'PIL', 'matplotlib', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'stat', 'yahoo_finance', 'pickle', 're', 'numpy', 'random', 'datetime', 'pydub', 'zipfile', 'unicodedata', 'requests', 'os', 'math', 'pptx', 'chess', 'Bio', 'queue', 'bs4', 'PyPDF2']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'random', 'scipy', 'collections', 'pydub', 'os', 'yahoo_finance', 'xml', 'csv', 'requests', 'json', 'stat', 'sklearn', 'bs4', 'datetime', 'pptx', 'pickle', 'chess', 'PyPDF2', 'time', 'pandas', 'pubchempy', 'queue', 'itertools', 'torch', 'Bio', 'numpy', 'unicodedata', 'matplotlib', 'statistics', 'io', 'sympy', 'zipfile', 'PIL', 'fractions', 'cv2', 're']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt.

Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible!

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['pandas', 'Bio', 'sympy', 'xml', 'math', 'torch', 'chess', 'io', 'os', 'bs4', 'zipfile', 'time', 'pptx', 'statistics', 'random', 'scipy', 'pubchempy', 'pydub', 'unicodedata', 'PyPDF2', 'pickle', 'itertools', 'queue', 'numpy', 'fractions', 'cv2', 'sklearn', 'csv', 'collections', 'yahoo_finance', 're', 'stat', 'PIL', 'matplotlib', 'requests', 'json', 'datetime']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python.

Attachment: .cache/table1.jpg\"\n\nThought: To convert the table in the image to a pie chart, I will first need to extract the text from the image to get the data that is presented in the table. I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved. Now, I will use the `final_answer` tool to provide the path to the saved pie chart as the final output.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Pie chart saved at: data/tongagent/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Identify and list the types of fruits visible in this image. Attachment: .cache/000000202178.jpg\"\n\nThought: I will use the `objectlocation` tool to identify and list the types of fruits visible in the provided image. This tool will help localize different fruits present in the image, and I can then compile the identified types.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_types = objectlocation(object=\"fruit\", image_path=\".cache/000000202178.jpg\")\nprint(fruit_types)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: [[173.91, 2.34, 372.53, 87.86], [170.28, 2.32, 398.48, 121.89], [410.71, 42.45, 483.26, 130.54]]\n\n\nThought: Now, I have found bounding boxes of fruits. I will crop these regions of fruits and save in new files.\nCode:\n```py\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\nimage_path = \".cache/000000202178.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(image_path)\n\nroot = \".cache/output\"\nos.makedirs(root, exist_ok=True)\ncount = 0\nfor bbox in fruit_types:\n   crop_image = image.crop(bbox)\n   crop_image.save(f'{root}/{count}.jpg')\n   print(f'{root}/{count}.jpg')\n   count = count+1\n```<end_action>\nObservation: .cache/output/0.jpg, .cache/output/1.jpg, .cache/output/2.jpg,\n\nThought: I will list all the images in the folder '.cache/output', then apply the `visualizer` tool to each image for the types of fruits.\nCode: \n```py\nimage_folder_path = '.cache/output'\nimage_files = [file for file in os.listdir(image_folder_path) if file.endswith(('.jpg', '.png', '.jpeg'))]\nfor image_file in image_files:\n    image_path = os.path.join(image_folder_path, image_file)\n    fruit_type = visualizer(question=\"What types of fruits are visible in this image?\", image_path=image_path)\n    print(fruit_type)\nObservation: Pineapple\nBananas\nMango\n```<end_action>\n\nThought: I have identified the types of fruits present in the image. Now, I will compile the list of fruits and return it as the final answer.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_list = [\n    \"Pineapple\",\n    \"Bananas\",\n    \"Mango\"\n]\nfinal_answer(fruit_list)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['fractions', 'matplotlib', 'PIL', 'datetime', 'unicodedata', 're', 'math', 'csv', 'chess', 'collections', 'statistics', 'torch', 'scipy', 'yahoo_finance', 'pubchempy', 'numpy', 'cv2', 'pandas', 'random', 'xml', 'PyPDF2', 'pickle', 'itertools', 'os', 'sklearn', 'pptx', 'sympy', 'stat', 'time', 'requests', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'queue', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'io', 'json']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['time', 'pptx', 'xml', 'chess', 'csv', 'numpy', 'io', 'collections', 'json', 'yahoo_finance', 'pydub', 'random', 'statistics', 'requests', 'torch', 'matplotlib', 'math', 'PIL', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'sympy', 'pickle', 're', 'queue', 'cv2', 'os', 'stat', 'Bio', 'sklearn', 'PyPDF2', 'itertools', 'fractions', 'zipfile', 'unicodedata', 'scipy', 'datetime', 'pubchempy']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. DO NOT generate a code which does not call 'print()' beacuse you will lose this information. You can assume all tools must have a return that can be printed.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = ask_search_agent(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = ask_search_agent(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = ask_search_agent(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Convert the table into a pie chart.\"\n\nThought: To convert the table in the image to a pie chart, I will first need to extract the text from the image to get the data that is presented in the table. I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\"/home/zhigao/scratch2/agent_tuning/image_case2/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SALED AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = './sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: data/tongagent/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved. Now, I will use the `final_answer` tool to provide the path to the saved pie chart as the final output.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Pie chart saved at: data/tongagent/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Identify and list the types of fruits visible in this image.\"\n\nThought: I will use the `objectlocation` tool to identify and list the types of fruits visible in the provided image. This tool will help localize different fruits present in the image, and I can then compile the identified types.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_types = objectlocation(object=\"fruit\", image_path=\"data/tongagent/coco/train2017/000000202178.jpg\")\nprint(fruit_types)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: [[173.91, 2.34, 372.53, 87.86], [170.28, 2.32, 398.48, 121.89], [410.71, 42.45, 483.26, 130.54]]\n\n\nThought: Now, I have found bounding boxes of fruits. I will crop these regions of fruits and save in new files.\nCode:\n```py\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\nimage_path = \"data/tongagent/coco/train2017/000000202178.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(image_path)\n\nos.mkdir ('./temp_dir')\ncount=0\nfor bbox in fruit_types:\n   crop_image=image.crop(bbox)\n   crop_image.save(f'./temp_dir/{count}.jpg')\n   print (f'./temp_dir/{count}.jpg')\n   count=count+1\n```<end_action>\nObservation: ./temp_dir/0.jpg, ./temp_dir/1.jpg, ./temp_dir/2.jpg,\n\nThought: I will list all the images in the folder './temp_dir', then apply the `visualizer` tool to each image for the types of fruits.\nCode: \n```py\nimage_folder_path = '/home/zhigao/scratch2/agent_tuning/image_case'\nimage_files = [file for file in os.listdir(image_folder_path) if file.endswith(('.jpg', '.png', '.jpeg'))]\nfor image_file in image_files:\n    image_path = os.path.join(image_folder_path, image_file)\n    fruit_type = visualizer(question=\"What types of fruits are visible in this image?\", image_path=image_path)\n    print(fruit_type)\nObservation: Pineapple\nBananas\nMango\n```<end_action>\n\nThought: I have identified the types of fruits present in the image.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. DO NOT generate a code which does not call 'print()' because you will lose this information. You can assume all tools must have a return that can be printed. \nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nYou will save all intermediate file outputs to a folder by the relative path '.cache'.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. \n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = ask_search_agent(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = ask_search_agent(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = ask_search_agent(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['chess', 'queue', 'pandas', 'cv2', 'sympy', 'bs4', 'pubchempy', 'yahoo_finance', 'unicodedata', 'csv', 'fractions', 'time', 'statistics', 'PyPDF2', 'json', 'math', 'xml', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'stat', 'collections', 'random', 'zipfile', 'os', 'sklearn', 'pydub', 'requests', 'torch', 'numpy', 'pickle', 'io', 'matplotlib', 'Bio', 'scipy', 're', 'pptx', 'PIL']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['csv', 'statistics', 'collections', 'time', 'math', 'matplotlib', 'PIL', 'random', 'sklearn', 'sympy', 'Bio', 'unicodedata', 'json', 'requests', 'pubchempy', 'torch', 'cv2', 'queue', 'chess', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'PyPDF2', 'pptx', 'os', 'pickle', 'io', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'xml', 'pydub', 'numpy', 'stat', 'zipfile', 'yahoo_finance', 'datetime', 're']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['sklearn', 'fractions', 'Bio', 'xml', 'bs4', 'pptx', 'csv', 'statistics', 're', 'cv2', 'pydub', 'itertools', 'zipfile', 'PIL', 'stat', 'requests', 'yahoo_finance', 'os', 'math', 'pandas', 'json', 'torch', 'numpy', 'pickle', 'time', 'unicodedata', 'queue', 'collections', 'sympy', 'pubchempy', 'random', 'io', 'scipy', 'chess', 'matplotlib', 'PyPDF2', 'datetime']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'queue', 'pandas', 'datetime', 'csv', 'requests', 'Bio', 'torch', 'statistics', 'PyPDF2', 'sklearn', 'pydub', 'io', 'pptx', 'matplotlib', 'stat', 'random', 'chess', 'json', 'unicodedata', 'bs4', 'sympy', 're', 'numpy', 'fractions', 'scipy', 'collections', 'pubchempy', 'PIL', 'pickle', 'time', 'xml', 'itertools', 'os', 'yahoo_finance', 'cv2', 'zipfile']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. DO NOT generate a code which does not call 'print()' because you will lose this information. You can assume all tools must have a return that can be printed. \nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nYou will save all intermediate file outputs to a folder by the relative path '.cache'.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. \n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = ask_search_agent(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = ask_search_agent(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = ask_search_agent(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

Attachment: .cache/table1.jpg\"\n\nThought: To convert the table in the image to a pie chart, I will first need to extract the text from the image to get the data that is presented in the table. I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved. Now, I will use the `final_answer` tool to provide the path to the saved pie chart as the final output.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Pie chart saved at: data/tongagent/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Identify and list the types of fruits visible in this image.

I will crop these regions of fruits and save in new files.\nCode:\n```py\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\nimage_path = \".cache/000000202178.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(image_path)\n\nroot = \".cache/output\"\nos.makedirs(root, exist_ok=True)\ncount = 0\nfor bbox in fruit_types:\n   crop_image = image.crop(bbox)\n   crop_image.save(f'{root}/{count}.jpg')\n   print(f'{root}/{count}.jpg')\n   count = count+1\n```<end_action>\nObservation: .cache/output/0.jpg, .cache/output/1.jpg, .cache/output/2.jpg,\n\nThought: I will list all the images in the folder '.cache/output', then apply the `visualizer` tool to each image for the types of fruits.\nCode: \n```py\nimage_folder_path = '.cache/output'\nimage_files = [file for file in os.listdir(image_folder_path) if file.endswith(('.jpg', '.png', '.jpeg'))]\nfor image_file in image_files:\n    image_path = os.path.join(image_folder_path, image_file)\n    fruit_type = visualizer(question=\"What types of fruits are visible in this image?\", image_path=image_path)\n    print(fruit_type)\nObservation: Pineapple\nBananas\nMango\n```<end_action>\n\nThought: I have identified the types of fruits present in the image. Now, I will compile the list of fruits and return it as the final answer.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_list = [\n    \"Pineapple\",\n    \"Bananas\",\n    \"Mango\"\n]\nfinal_answer(fruit_list)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\"/home/zhigao/scratch2/agent_tuning/image_case2/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SALED AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = './sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: data/tongagent/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

This tool will help localize different fruits present in the image, and I can then compile the identified types.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_types = objectlocation(object=\"fruit\", image_path=\"data/tongagent/coco/train2017/000000202178.jpg\")\nprint(fruit_types)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: [[173.91, 2.34, 372.53, 87.86], [170.28, 2.32, 398.48, 121.89], [410.71, 42.45, 483.26, 130.54]]\n\n\nThought: Now, I have found bounding boxes of fruits. I will crop these regions of fruits and save in new files.\nCode:\n```py\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\nimage_path = \"data/tongagent/coco/train2017/000000202178.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(image_path)\n\nos.mkdir ('./temp_dir')\ncount=0\nfor bbox in fruit_types:\n   crop_image=image.crop(bbox)\n   crop_image.save(f'./temp_dir/{count}.jpg')\n   print (f'./temp_dir/{count}.jpg')\n   count=count+1\n```<end_action>\nObservation: ./temp_dir/0.jpg, ./temp_dir/1.jpg, ./temp_dir/2.jpg,\n\nThought: I will list all the images in the folder './temp_dir', then apply the `visualizer` tool to each image for the types of fruits.\nCode: \n```py\nimage_folder_path = '/home/zhigao/scratch2/agent_tuning/image_case'\nimage_files = [file for file in os.listdir(image_folder_path) if file.endswith(('.jpg', '.png', '.jpeg'))]\nfor image_file in image_files:\n    image_path = os.path.join(image_folder_path, image_file)\n    fruit_type = visualizer(question=\"What types of fruits are visible in this image?\", image_path=image_path)\n    print(fruit_type)\nObservation: Pineapple\nBananas\nMango\n```<end_action>\n\nThought: I have identified the types of fruits present in the image.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'pydub', 'numpy', 'pubchempy', 'cv2', 'chess', 'matplotlib', 'xml', 're', 'datetime', 'zipfile', 'os', 'pickle', 'scipy', 'torch', 'statistics', 'sympy', 'random', 'collections', 'yahoo_finance', 'PIL', 'csv', 'unicodedata', 'requests', 'pptx', 'time', 'json', 'sklearn', 'math', 'io', 'Bio', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'itertools', 'PyPDF2', 'stat']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['pandas', 'Bio', 'sympy', 'xml', 'math', 'torch', 'chess', 'io', 'os', 'bs4', 'zipfile', 'time', 'pptx', 'statistics', 'random', 'scipy', 'pubchempy', 'pydub', 'unicodedata', 'PyPDF2', 'pickle', 'itertools', 'queue', 'numpy', 'fractions', 'cv2', 'sklearn', 'csv', 'collections', 'yahoo_finance', 're', 'stat', 'PIL', 'matplotlib', 'requests', 'json', 'datetime']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['re', 'math', 'sympy', 'zipfile', 'chess', 'requests', 'yahoo_finance', 'collections', 'PyPDF2', 'scipy', 'pptx', 'sklearn', 'cv2', 'random', 'json', 'Bio', 'time', 'queue', 'statistics', 'numpy', 'pickle', 'pandas', 'pubchempy', 'xml', 'datetime', 'matplotlib', 'stat', 'io', 'itertools', 'torch', 'pydub', 'PIL', 'fractions', 'os', 'csv', 'unicodedata', 'bs4']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['sklearn', 'scipy', 'json', 'stat', 'pandas', 'time', 'yahoo_finance', 'zipfile', 'bs4', 'matplotlib', 'pubchempy', 'cv2', 'io', 'unicodedata', 'random', 'collections', 'statistics', 'math', 'pydub', 'numpy', 're', 'PyPDF2', 'pptx', 'sympy', 'pickle', 'PIL', 'torch', 'xml', 'queue', 'fractions', 'itertools', 'requests', 'os', 'Bio', 'csv', 'datetime', 'chess']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

It may improve cholesterol levels and enhance the health of blood vessels.\n\n4. **Brain Health**: The L-theanine and caffeine in green tea can improve brain function, potentially reducing the risk of cognitive decline as one ages.\n\n5. **Diabetes Management**: Green tea may help lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity, making it beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes.\n\n6. **Cancer Prevention**: Some research suggests that the antioxidants in green tea can help lower the risk of certain types of cancer, although more research is needed for conclusive evidence.\n\n#### Black Tea Benefits:\n1. **Rich in Flavonoids**: Black tea contains flavonoids that may support heart health and reduce bad cholesterol levels, thus lowering the risk of cardiovascular diseases.\n\n2. **Boosts Gut Health**: Black tea can promote a healthy gut by supporting the growth of good bacteria and inhibiting harmful bacteria.\n\n3. **Mental Alertness**: The caffeine content in black tea can enhance alertness, cognitive function, and mood, making it a quick pick-me-up.\n\n4. **Bone Health**: Some studies indicate that the compounds in black tea may positively influence bone density and strength.\n\n5. **Reduction in Stroke Risk**: There is evidence to suggest that consuming black tea may be associated with a lower risk of stroke over time.\n\n6. **Lower Stress Levels**: Ingredients found in black tea can help reduce stress and promote relaxation, providing a calming effect.\n\n### Summary\nBoth green tea and black tea offer unique health benefits. Green tea is often praised for its high antioxidant content and potential weight loss benefits, while black tea is noted for its heart health and gut health benefits. Choosing between the two may depend on individual health goals, taste preferences, and caffeine sensitivity. Additionally, it's beneficial to incorporate both types into your diet for a broader range of health advantages.\n"

This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['PIL', 'io', 'torch', 'zipfile', 'requests', 'pydub', 'chess', 'random', 'pubchempy', 're', 'time', 'pptx', 'pickle', 'statistics', 'unicodedata', 'numpy', 'math', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'queue', 'stat', 'bs4', 'os', 'sympy', 'datetime', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'itertools', 'cv2', 'csv', 'collections', 'matplotlib', 'json', 'fractions', 'yahoo_finance']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python.

You can assume all tools must have a return that can be printed.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = ask_search_agent(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = ask_search_agent(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = ask_search_agent(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\"/home/zhigao/scratch2/agent_tuning/image_case2/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SALED AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = './sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: data/tongagent/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved. Now, I will use the `final_answer` tool to provide the path to the saved pie chart as the final output.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Pie chart saved at: data/tongagent/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Identify and list the types of fruits visible in this image.\"\n\nThought: I will use the `objectlocation` tool to identify and list the types of fruits visible in the provided image. This tool will help localize different fruits present in the image, and I can then compile the identified types.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_types = objectlocation(object=\"fruit\", image_path=\"data/tongagent/coco/train2017/000000202178.jpg\")\nprint(fruit_types)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: [[173.91, 2.34, 372.53, 87.86], [170.28, 2.32, 398.48, 121.89], [410.71, 42.45, 483.26, 130.54]]\n\n\nThought: Now, I have found bounding boxes of fruits. I will crop these regions of fruits and save in new files.\nCode:\n```py\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\nimage_path = \"data/tongagent/coco/train2017/000000202178.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(image_path)\n\nos.mkdir ('./temp_dir')\ncount=0\nfor bbox in fruit_types:\n   crop_image=image.crop(bbox)\n   crop_image.save(f'./temp_dir/{count}.jpg')\n   print (f'./temp_dir/{count}.jpg')\n   count=count+1\n```<end_action>\nObservation: ./temp_dir/0.jpg, ./temp_dir/1.jpg, ./temp_dir/2.jpg,\n\nThought: I will list all the images in the folder './temp_dir', then apply the `visualizer` tool to each image for the types of fruits.\nCode: \n```py\nimage_folder_path = '/home/zhigao/scratch2/agent_tuning/image_case'\nimage_files = [file for file in os.listdir(image_folder_path) if file.endswith(('.jpg', '.png', '.jpeg'))]\nfor image_file in image_files:\n    image_path = os.path.join(image_folder_path, image_file)\n    fruit_type = visualizer(question=\"What types of fruits are visible in this image?\", image_path=image_path)\n    print(fruit_type)\nObservation: Pineapple\nBananas\nMango\n```<end_action>\n\nThought: I have identified the types of fruits present in the image. Now, I will compile the list of fruits and return it as the final answer.\nCode: \nCode:\n```py\nfruit_list = [\n    \"Pineapple\",\n    \"Bananas\",\n    \"Mango\"\n]\nfinal_answer(fruit_list)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

You can assume all tools must have a return that can be printed.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = ask_search_agent(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = ask_search_agent(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = ask_search_agent(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Convert the table into a pie chart.\"\n\nThought: To convert the table in the image to a pie chart, I will first need to extract the text from the image to get the data that is presented in the table. I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\"/home/zhigao/scratch2/agent_tuning/image_case2/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SALED AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = './sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: data/tongagent/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved. Now, I will use the `final_answer` tool to provide the path to the saved pie chart as the final output.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Pie chart saved at: data/tongagent/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Identify and list the types of fruits visible in this image.\"\n\nThought: I will use the `objectlocation` tool to identify and list the types of fruits visible in the provided image. This tool will help localize different fruits present in the image, and I can then compile the identified types.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_types = objectlocation(object=\"fruit\", image_path=\"data/tongagent/coco/train2017/000000202178.jpg\")\nprint(fruit_types)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: [[173.91, 2.34, 372.53, 87.86], [170.28, 2.32, 398.48, 121.89], [410.71, 42.45, 483.26, 130.54]]\n\n\nThought: Now, I have found bounding boxes of fruits. I will crop these regions of fruits and save in new files.\nCode:\n```py\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\nimage_path = \"data/tongagent/coco/train2017/000000202178.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(image_path)\n\nos.mkdir ('./temp_dir')\ncount=0\nfor bbox in fruit_types:\n   crop_image=image.crop(bbox)\n   crop_image.save(f'./temp_dir/{count}.jpg')\n   print (f'./temp_dir/{count}.jpg')\n   count=count+1\n```<end_action>\nObservation: ./temp_dir/0.jpg, ./temp_dir/1.jpg, ./temp_dir/2.jpg,\n\nThought: I will list all the images in the folder './temp_dir', then apply the `visualizer` tool to each image for the types of fruits.\nCode: \n```py\nimage_folder_path = '/home/zhigao/scratch2/agent_tuning/image_case'\nimage_files = [file for file in os.listdir(image_folder_path) if file.endswith(('.jpg', '.png', '.jpeg'))]\nfor image_file in image_files:\n    image_path = os.path.join(image_folder_path, image_file)\n    fruit_type = visualizer(question=\"What types of fruits are visible in this image?\", image_path=image_path)\n    print(fruit_type)\nObservation: Pineapple\nBananas\nMango\n```<end_action>\n\nThought: I have identified the types of fruits present in the image. Now, I will compile the list of fruits and return it as the final answer.\nCode: \nCode:\n```py\nfruit_list = [\n    \"Pineapple\",\n    \"Bananas\",\n    \"Mango\"\n]\nfinal_answer(fruit_list)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'pydub', 'numpy', 'pubchempy', 'cv2', 'chess', 'matplotlib', 'xml', 're', 'datetime', 'zipfile', 'os', 'pickle', 'scipy', 'torch', 'statistics', 'sympy', 'random', 'collections', 'yahoo_finance', 'PIL', 'csv', 'unicodedata', 'requests', 'pptx', 'time', 'json', 'sklearn', 'math', 'io', 'Bio', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'itertools', 'PyPDF2', 'stat']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['yahoo_finance', 'statistics', 'datetime', 'numpy', 'math', 'cv2', 'fractions', 'chess', 'zipfile', 'scipy', 'sympy', 'time', 'collections', 'pptx', 'json', 'requests', 'queue', 'xml', 're', 'pickle', 'PyPDF2', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'torch', 'stat', 'os', 'sklearn', 'io', 'matplotlib', 'pydub', 'csv', 'unicodedata', 'pubchempy', 'random', 'PIL', 'itertools', 'pandas']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instance segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'scipy', 'PIL', 'pickle', 'bs4', 're', 'cv2', 'unicodedata', 'Bio', 'fractions', 'sklearn', 'pydub', 'collections', 'itertools', 'torch', 'pptx', 'yahoo_finance', 'numpy', 'matplotlib', 'PyPDF2', 'sympy', 'datetime', 'time', 'xml', 'random', 'chess', 'requests', 'pandas', 'csv', 'math', 'zipfile', 'json', 'stat', 'statistics', 'os']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'pydub', 'numpy', 'pubchempy', 'cv2', 'chess', 'matplotlib', 'xml', 're', 'datetime', 'zipfile', 'os', 'pickle', 'scipy', 'torch', 'statistics', 'sympy', 'random', 'collections', 'yahoo_finance', 'PIL', 'csv', 'unicodedata', 'requests', 'pptx', 'time', 'json', 'sklearn', 'math', 'io', 'Bio', 'fractions', 'pandas', 'bs4', 'itertools', 'PyPDF2', 'stat']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['sympy', 'os', 'random', 'stat', 'chess', 'datetime', 'Bio', 'pubchempy', 'time', 're', 'requests', 'pydub', 'xml', 'PIL', 'pptx', 'cv2', 'pandas', 'csv', 'PyPDF2', 'matplotlib', 'torch', 'statistics', 'math', 'unicodedata', 'io', 'scipy', 'collections', 'yahoo_finance', 'json', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'pickle', 'numpy', 'sklearn', 'queue', 'zipfile', 'fractions']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

Search Outcome (Short Version):\nTokyo-Yokohama, Japan, is the largest urban agglomeration in 2023 with a population of about 37.8 million. Following Tokyo are:\n- Jakarta, Indonesia: 35.4 million\n- Delhi, India: 31.2 million\n- Guangzhou-Foshan, China: 27.1 million\n- Mumbai, India: 25.2 million\n\n### 2. Search Outcome (Extremely Detailed Version):\nThe most populous cities in the world as of 2023 are characterized by urban agglomerations surpassing mere city limits. Tokyo-Yokohama leads due to its well-established transit systems and economic dynamism. Jakarta's growth is fueled by substantial rural-to-urban migration and infrastructure development. Delhi's burgeoning population is supported by high birth rates and expansive metro connectivity. Guangzhou-Foshan, part of China's Pearl River Delta, benefits from its status as a manufacturing hub. Mumbai, with its significant share of India’s financial activity, sees continued growth through migration and development initiatives.\n\n### 3. Additional Context:\n**Definitions: Urban Agglomeration vs. City Proper** - 'Urban agglomeration' includes the total population of a contiguous urban area beyond set administrative boundaries. 'City proper,' however, considers only those within the official city limits, often excluding suburbs.\n\n**Economic, Migration, and Demographic Factors:** Rapid urbanization and migration trends are contributing significantly to population increases. Cities like Delhi and Mumbai continue to see growth due to high birth rates and thriving sectors attracting workers nationally and internationally.\n\nComprehensive urban plans and economic policies also drive the rankings, reinforcing growth in these urban centers.\n"

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['PIL', 'io', 'torch', 'zipfile', 'requests', 'pydub', 'chess', 'random', 'pubchempy', 're', 'time', 'pptx', 'pickle', 'statistics', 'unicodedata', 'numpy', 'math', 'scipy', 'sklearn', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'queue', 'stat', 'bs4', 'os', 'sympy', 'datetime', 'Bio', 'pandas', 'itertools', 'cv2', 'csv', 'collections', 'matplotlib', 'json', 'fractions', 'yahoo_finance']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- objectlocation: A tool that can localize objects in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the objects.\n    Takes inputs: {'object': {'description': 'the object that need to be localized', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'type': 'text', 'description': \"The image generator prompt. Don't hesitate to add details in the prompt to make the image look better, like 'high-res, photorealistic', etc.\"}}\n\n- segmentation: A tool that can do instantce segmentation on the given image.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path of image that the tool can read.', 'type': 'text'}, 'prompt': {'description': \"The bounding box that you want this model to segment. The bounding boxes could be from user input or tool `objectlocation`. You can set it as None or empty list to enable 'Segment Anything' mode.\", 'type': 'list'}}\n\n- image_edit: A tool that can edit image based on the user prompt. Return a file path for printing.\n    Takes inputs: {'prompt': {'description': 'The user prompt that instruct how to edit the image.', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The image path that this tool will try to edit.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- ask_search_agent: This will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question. Ask him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving. Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe! And don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['re', 'pickle', 'xml', 'matplotlib', 'json', 'time', 'collections', 'itertools', 'random', 'statistics', 'sklearn', 'pandas', 'pptx', 'unicodedata', 'queue', 'pubchempy', 'fractions', 'torch', 'csv', 'Bio', 'io', 'PIL', 'datetime', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'scipy', 'chess', 'bs4', 'PyPDF2', 'requests', 'stat', 'cv2', 'os', 'yahoo_finance', 'numpy', 'sympy', 'math']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.

I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library.

Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved.

                "value": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. DO NOT generate a code which does not call 'print()' because you will lose this information. You can assume all tools must have a return that can be printed. \nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nYou will save all intermediate file outputs to a folder by the relative path '.cache'.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. \n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = ask_search_agent(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = ask_search_agent(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `ask_search_agent` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = ask_search_agent(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Convert the table into a pie chart. Attachment: .cache/table1.jpg\"\n\nThought: To convert the table in the image to a pie chart, I will first need to extract the text from the image to get the data that is presented in the table. I will use the `visualizer` tool to analyze the image and extract the textual information in the table format. After that, I can process the data and create a pie chart using a plotting library. I'll start by extracting the text from the image of the table.\nCode:\n```py\ntable_data = visualizer(question=\"Please extract the data from the table in the image.\", image_path=\".cache/table1.jpg\")\nprint(table_data)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Here is the extracted data from the table:\n| PRODUCT NAME | SOLD AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------|\n| PRODUCT1   | 500      |\n| PRODUCT2   | 501      |\n| PRODUCT3   | 502      |\n| PRODUCT4   | 503      |\n| PRODUCT5   | 504      |\n| PRODUCT6   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT7   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT8   | 0        |\n| PRODUCT9   | 508      |\n| PRODUCT10  | 509      |\n| PRODUCT11  | 510      |\n\nThought: Now that I have extracted the data from the table, I will process it to extract the product names and their respective sales totals. Using this data, I can then create a pie chart to visually represent the sales distribution among the different products. First, I will organize the data into a suitable format, and then I will use the `matplotlib` library to create the pie chart.\nCode:\n```py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data extracted from the table\nproducts = [\"PRODUCT1\", \"PRODUCT2\", \"PRODUCT3\", \"PRODUCT4\", \"PRODUCT5\", \"PRODUCT6\", \"PRODUCT7\", \"PRODUCT8\", \"PRODUCT9\", \"PRODUCT10\", \"PRODUCT11\"]\nsales = [500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 0, 0, 0, 508, 509, 510]\n# Creating a pie chart\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.pie(sales, labels=products, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title(\"Sales Distribution by Product\")\nplt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie chart is circular.\n# Saving the pie chart to a file\nchart_path = '.cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg'\nplt.savefig(chart_path)\nplt.close()\nprint(\"Pie chart saved at:\", chart_path)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: Pie chart saved at: .cache/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\n\nThought: The pie chart representing the sales distribution by product has been successfully created and saved. Now, I will use the `final_answer` tool to provide the path to the saved pie chart as the final output.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Pie chart saved at: data/tongagent/sales_distribution_pie_chart.jpg\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Identify and list the types of fruits visible in this image. Attachment: .cache/000000202178.jpg\"\n\nThought: I will use the `objectlocation` tool to identify and list the types of fruits visible in the provided image. This tool will help localize different fruits present in the image, and I can then compile the identified types.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_types = objectlocation(object=\"fruit\", image_path=\".cache/000000202178.jpg\")\nprint(fruit_types)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: [[173.91, 2.34, 372.53, 87.86], [170.28, 2.32, 398.48, 121.89], [410.71, 42.45, 483.26, 130.54]]\n\n\nThought: Now, I have found bounding boxes of fruits. I will crop these regions of fruits and save in new files.\nCode:\n```py\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\nimage_path = \".cache/000000202178.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(image_path)\n\nroot = \".cache/output\"\nos.makedirs(root, exist_ok=True)\ncount = 0\nfor bbox in fruit_types:\n   crop_image = image.crop(bbox)\n   crop_image.save(f'{root}/{count}.jpg')\n   print(f'{root}/{count}.jpg')\n   count = count+1\n```<end_action>\nObservation: .cache/output/0.jpg, .cache/output/1.jpg, .cache/output/2.jpg,\n\nThought: I will list all the images in the folder '.cache/output', then apply the `visualizer` tool to each image for the types of fruits.\nCode: \n```py\nimage_folder_path = '.cache/output'\nimage_files = [file for file in os.listdir(image_folder_path) if file.endswith(('.jpg', '.png', '.jpeg'))]\nfor image_file in image_files:\n    image_path = os.path.join(image_folder_path, image_file)\n    fruit_type = visualizer(question=\"What types of fruits are visible in this image?\", image_path=image_path)\n    print(fruit_type)\nObservation: Pineapple\nBananas\nMango\n```<end_action>\n\nThought: I have identified the types of fruits present in the image. Now, I will compile the list of fruits and return it as the final answer.\nCode:\n```py\nfruit_list = [\n    \"Pineapple\",\n    \"Bananas\",\n    \"Mango\"\n]\nfinal_answer(fruit_list)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to those tools:\n\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- facedetection: A tool that can detect human faces in given images, outputing the bounding boxes of the human faces.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to localize objects.
